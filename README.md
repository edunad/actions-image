## How to tag images on code

Save your image name with following format and convert it to **base64**

```
filePath[==]line:column
```

### For example :

```
tests/mycode/basic-test.spec.js[==]80:30
```

Then on NodeJS save the image as

```
const fs = require('fs');
const imageName = Buffer.from(`tests/mycode/basic-test.spec.js[==]80:30`).toString('base64');

fs.writeFileSync(`${imageName}.png`, ...etc)
```

It will then apply the add an annotation like
